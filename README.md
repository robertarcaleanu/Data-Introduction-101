# Data-Introduction-101

Hi! Welcome to my Data Introduction repositoy, I hope you find it useful!

## Scope

## Set Up

In my opinion, the set-up is the most overwhelming part for a beginer. This instends to recommend the easiest tools to start working with Data.

### Programming languages

I would say, there are two main languages for Data Analysis / Data Science, and these are R and Python. Despite being a defender of R, I believe Python is option to choose if you are looking to break into this world.

* **R:** it can be  downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
* **Python:** in order to install Python, I recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/). The only thing you shjould pay attention to is adding it to PATH.

### IDE

IDE stands for integrated development environment and it is basically the UI where we will write our scripts. For each programming language, I recommend the following:

* **RStudio:** this is the best option for R. You can download it [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
* **Visual Studio Code:** I recommend this option for Python because it is very easy to use but very powerful. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
