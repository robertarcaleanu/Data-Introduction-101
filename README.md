# Data-Introduction-101

Hi! Welcome to my Data Introduction repositoy, I hope you find it useful!

## Scope

## Set Up

In my opinion, the set-up is the most overwhelming part for a beginer. This instends to recommend the easiest tools to start working with Data.

### Programming languages

I would say, there are two main languages for Data Analysis / Data Science, and these are R and Python. Despite being a defender of R, I believe Python is option to choose if you are looking to break into this world.

* **R:** it can be  downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
* **Python:** in order to install Python, I recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/). The only thing you shjould pay attention to is adding it to PATH.

### IDE

IDE stands for integrated development environment and it is basically the UI where we will write our scripts. For each programming language, I recommend the following:

* **RStudio:** this is the best option for R. You can download it [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
* **Visual Studio Code:** I recommend this option for Python because it is very easy to use but very powerful. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Basic Tools

This section inteds to introduce you to the most common tools that someone starting working with data should know about. Additionally, it provides resources to practice each one in more detail.

### Excel

Like it or not, Excel is the most common tool when dealing with data. Despite all its weekneses when it comes to more technical analysis, Excel is widely used by a lot of users. These range from Analysts to Executives, therefore, I believe a minimum of knowledge of excel is required. For me, this knowledge should include:

* Basic data cleaning tasks
* Vlookup (or alternatively xlookup)
* Filtering
* Pivot tables
* Simple charts
* Key shortcuts

Excel supports more advanced tools, like Power Query, but for me this would be enough to feel comfortale with Excel.

### Python

Just like Excel is a staple for data work, Python has become an essential tool for anyone dealing with data on a deeper level. Python's importance stems from its versatility and the powerful libraries it offers for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Whether you're working on simple data cleaning tasks or advanced machine learning models, Python provides a robust platform that can handle the scale and complexity that Excel might struggle with. For those working with data, I believe a minimum knowledge of Python should include:

- Basic data manipulation with libraries like Pandas
- Data visualization using Matplotlib or Seaborn
- Understanding of how to write and run scripts
- Ability to automate repetitive tasks
- Basic understanding of statistical analysis

These skills in Python can significantly enhance your ability to work with data efficiently and accurately, opening up new possibilities beyond what traditional tools can offer.

### R

### SQL

SQL is a fundamental tool for anyone working with data. Despite the rise of various data analysis tools and languages, SQL remains the backbone of data querying and manipulation. It’s used by everyone from Data Analysts to Data Engineers, making a basic understanding of SQL essential. In my opinion, this knowledge should include:

- Writing basic SELECT queries
- Filtering data using WHERE clauses
- Joining tables effectively
- Aggregating data with GROUP BY and HAVING
- Understanding and creating indexes for performance optimization

While SQL can be much more powerful, mastering these basics will make you more comfortable and efficient when dealing with data in any environment."

### PowerBI and Tableau

Finally, Tableau and Power BI are becoming essential tools for anyone working with data. While traditional spreadsheets like Excel have their place, these modern data visualization platforms offer powerful features that go beyond basic analysis. Tableau and Power BI allow users to create interactive dashboards, handle large datasets, and derive insights quickly—capabilities that are increasingly expected in roles ranging from Data Analysts to Business Managers. A solid understanding of these tools should include:

- Data connection and transformation
- Building and customizing visualizations
- Creating interactive dashboards
- Using DAX (for Power BI) or calculated fields (for Tableau)

Mastering these skills not only makes data more accessible and actionable but also enhances decision-making processes across organizations.
