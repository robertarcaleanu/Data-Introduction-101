# Data-Introduction-101

Hi! Welcome to my Data Introduction repositoy, I hope you find it useful!

## Scope

## Set Up

In my opinion, the set-up is the most overwhelming part for a beginer. This instends to recommend the easiest tools to start working with Data.

### Programming languages

I would say, there are two main languages for Data Analysis / Data Science, and these are R and Python. Despite being a defender of R, I believe Python is option to choose if you are looking to break into this world.

* **R:** it can be  downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
* **Python:** in order to install Python, I recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/). The only thing you shjould pay attention to is adding it to PATH.

### IDE

IDE stands for integrated development environment and it is basically the UI where we will write our scripts. For each programming language, I recommend the following:

* **RStudio:** this is the best option for R. You can download it [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
* **Visual Studio Code:** I recommend this option for Python because it is very easy to use but very powerful. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Basic Tools

This section inteds to introduce you to the most common tools that someone starting working with data should know about. Additionally, it provides resources to practice each one in more detail.

### Excel

Like it or not, Excel is the most common tool when dealing with data. Despite all its weekneses when it comes to more technical analysis, Excel is widely used by a lot of users. These range from Analysts to Executives, therefore, I believe a minimum of knowledge of excel is required. For me, this knowledge should include:

* Basic data cleaning tasks
* Vlookup (or alternatively xlookup)
* Filtering
* Pivot tables
* Simple charts
* Key shortcuts

Excel supports more advanced tools, like Power Query, but for me this would be enough to feel comfortale with Excel.
